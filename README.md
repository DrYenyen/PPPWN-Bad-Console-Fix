# PPPWN-Bad-Console-Fix
*An edit of PPPWN by theflow edited by a discord friend ->''😶‍🌫️''*  
**The change allows consoles that get stuck at STAGE2 Defeating KASLR to get past it and go to STAGE 3 or 4**   
**Currently the console it was tested on still crashes around STAGE 3 and 4 but this is being put out to test with working and non working consoles**    
**Anyone who clones this and finds a fix can report back and we are also still working on fully fixing it ourselves**
