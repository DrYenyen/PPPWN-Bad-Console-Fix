# PPPWN-Bad-Console-Fix
**An edit of PPPWN by theflow edited by a discord friend ->''😶‍🌫️''**  
**The change allows consoles that get stuck at STAGE2 Defeating KASLR to get past it and go to STAGE 3 or 4**   
**Currently the console it was tested on still crashes around STAGE 3 and 4 but this is being put out to test with working and non working consoles**    
**Anyone who clones this and finds a fix can report back and we are also still working on fully fixing it ourselves**  
  
# How to use  
**This is used the same way like before the C++ edit was made just have the offsets and correct stage 1 and 2 bins in their usual sub folders and goldhen.bin on a usb if it doesnt crash**    
python3 pppwn.py --interface= --fw=  add your ethernet adapter name after the --interface= and your firmware after the --fw=
